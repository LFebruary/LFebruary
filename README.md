# Hi, I'm Lyle February

## Short introduction

![Introduction logo](https://i.ibb.co/j83Kn8G/Github-Image.jpg "The only constant in the technology industry is change - Marc Benioff")

I am an organized, dedicated software developer with 3-4 years of experience in development.

This includes design, development and deployment.

I am energetic, logical, innovative, analytical and like to learn new skills continuously.

Currently working for [DotDigital](https://dotdigital.com/) as a software engineer.

## Purpose

I will be creating/maintaining repositories on here with the intent of:

- Tracking learning progress as I experiment/work with new tools and/or frameworks
- Sharing custom classes and/or methods that might be useful to others
- Hopefully create some really useful open-source projects that can be plugged into *your projects*

**Some of these projects might not make sense or have commercial value necessarily, but will mainly serve as an example use-case/implementation**
